# Mechanical Engineering Projects
This repository contains an overview of some of the notable mechanical engineering projects I completed during my undergraduate journey. 

## Introduction

Apart from an opportunity to work with the Surface Science and Tribology (SST) Lab for my capstone project as part of my Mechanical Engineering degree, I took up an additional initiative under the Opportunities for Undergraduate Research (OUR) scheme to pursue research into the hydrophobic properties of marine grade alloys for their ‘self-cleaning’ applications, a novel method with applications across industries. This project secured substantial departmental funding and received recognition from across departments for its domain-agnostic applications. My thesis and capstone project was centered around honing my technical skills and delving into one of the foundational principles of the engineering domain. We used biomimicry and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to design and create nanostructures that would optimize the erosion-corrosion resistance of certain alloys. We devised a low-cost and time-efficient solution to create these structures on additively manufactured (3D printed) samples.

## Project Overview

### Creation of Imprinted Textured Substrates to Evaluate their Erosion - Corrosion Resistance
- We implement biomimicry to create different types of microstructures on alloys to understand how it affects their erosion and corrosion properties. We used a low-cost and more efficient solution of Imprinting to create these structures and extended the study to compare the performance of these microstructures in Conventionally and Additively manufactured (3D Printed) samples for applications in various industries.

### A CFD Study to Understand the Role of Surface Textures on Erosion Wear
- We used Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD: Ansys Fluent and Workbench 2022 R1, CAD: SpaceClaim 2022 R1) to simulate erosive wear on microtextured substrates to understand how we could further optimize the Depth, Cross-Sectional Shape, and Pattern types of the structures, to minimize the overall erosive wear under its respective operating conditions.

### Investigating the Interplay between Wetting and Droplet Friction
- We studied and modeled the various factors that govern the motion of a liquid droplet on the inclined surfaces of Marine Grade Aluminum (AA5083) and optimized its performance under various operating conditions, tuning its hydrophobic properties for self-cleaning applications across sectors.
